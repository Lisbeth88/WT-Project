# Project guidelines

- Participants must sign in to the available [Sidweb](https://www.sidweb.espol.edu.ec/) groups.
- Each group has a group number assigned (based on Sidweb).
- A directory called `group[number]` is available to each group and it represents the group's _**working directory**_.
- All project info (data, source code, resources) should be maintained within your working directory.
- A `README.md` file is located in your working directory. Please update it using the project information. This file represents your project proposal.
- You are free to add files and create folders in your working directory.

## Collaboration

- Each group must work in a defined branch. Aforementioned is to avoid pulling unnecessary data from other working directories.
- The `master` branch will contain your final version by the deadline. It will probably be protected to avoid pushing changes to the `master` branch.
- Before the deadline, you will merge your `group[number]`branch to the `master` branch.
- Use the issue section on Github to discuss your project.


## Deliverables

- Link to the video (Presentation).
- An updated working directory (push, commit).
  - This includes all content of your working directory.

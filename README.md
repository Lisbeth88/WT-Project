# Project guidelines

- Participants must sign in to the available [Sidweb](https://www.sidweb.espol.edu.ec/) groups.
- Each group has a group number assigned (based on Sidweb).
- A directory called `group[number]` is available to each group and it represents the group's _**working directory**_.
- All project info should be maintained within your working directory.
- A `README.md` file is located in your working directory. Please update it using the project information.
- You are free to add files and create folders in your working directory.

## Collaboration

- To avoid pulling data from other working directories, each group will work in a defined branch.
- The Master branch will contain only your final version of the project at the end of the deadline.
- Before the deadline, you will merge your branch to the master.
- Use the issue section on Github to discuss your project.


## Deliverables

- Link to the video (Presentation).
- An updated working directory (push, commit).
  - This includes all content of your working directory.
